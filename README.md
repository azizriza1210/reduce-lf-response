## üéØ Problem Statement

Currently, chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being developed and widely discussed. However, since LLMs are trained on large-scale datasets collected from diverse internet sources, they are still prone to generating responses that contain logical fallacies. If left unaddressed, such occurrences may affect the accuracy and quality of information received by users.

## üí° Solution

The prompt engineering approach is employed as a solution to reduce chatbot responses containing logical fallacies. This approach is designed through an adjusted workflow that builds upon insights and findings from existing research studies.

This approach is developed using several supporting technologies, including:

- **LangChain**: A framework for building Large Language Model (LLM)‚Äìbased applications that supports chaining and pipeline processes between AI components.
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: A platform that provides the LLM used as the core model of the system.
